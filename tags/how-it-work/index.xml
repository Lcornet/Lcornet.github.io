      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/images/citizen.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;citizen&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Oxygenic photosynthesis is a biochemical process of fundamental importance for life on Earth, as it converts solar energy into chemical energy while releasing oxygen. This process emerged more than 2.4 billion years ago within cyanobacteria, a group of bacteria that subsequently colonized a wide range of terrestrial and aquatic habitats.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Cyanobacteria are responsible for a substantial fraction of global photosynthesis, notably through their presence in marine phytoplankton. Among extant cyanobacteria, there is a very primitive group known as the Gloeobacterales, which is distinguished by the absence of thylakoids, an intracellular structure essential for photosynthesis in most cyanobacteria. This absence makes Gloeobacterales an important source of information for understanding the origin and evolution of oxygenic photosynthesis.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
