      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Luc Cornet, Annick Wilmotte, Emmanuelle J. Javaux and Denis Baurain&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Cyanobacteria are an ancient phylum of prokaryotes that contain the class Oxyphotobacteria. This group has been extensively studied by phylogenomics notably because it is widely accepted that Cyanobacteria were responsible for the spread of photosynthesis to the eukaryotic domain. The aim of this study was to evaluate the fraction of the oxyphotobacterial diversity for which sequenced genomes are available for genomic studies. For this, we built a phylogenomic-constrained SSU rRNA (16S) tree to pinpoint unexploited clusters of Oxyphotobacteria that should be targeted for future genome sequencing, so as to improve our understanding of Oxyphotobacteria evolution.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s13104-018-3543-y&#34;&gt;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s13104-018-3543-y&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Consensus assessment of the contamination level of publicly available cyanobacterial genomes</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Luc Cornet, Loïc Meunier, Mick Van Vlierberghe, Raphaël R. Léonard, Benoit Durieu, Yannick Lara, Agnieszka Misztak, Damien Sirjacobs, Emmanuelle J. Javaux, Hervé Philippe, Annick Wilmotte, Denis Baurain&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Publicly available genomes are crucial for phylogenetic and metagenomic studies, in which contaminating sequences can be the cause of major problems. This issue is expected to be especially important for Cyanobacteria because axenic strains are notoriously difficult to obtain and keep in culture. Yet, despite their great scientific interest, no data are currently available concerning the quality of publicly available cyanobacterial genomes. As reliably detecting contaminants is a complex task, we designed a pipeline combining six methods in a consensus strategy to assess the contamination level of 440 genome assemblies of Cyanobacteria. Two methods are based on published reference databases of ribosomal genes (SSU rRNA 16S and ribosomal proteins), one is indirectly based on a reference database of marker genes (CheckM), and three are based on complete genome analysis. Among those genome-wide methods, Kraken and DIAMOND blastx share the same reference database that we derived from Ensembl Bacteria, whereas CONCOCT does not require any reference database, instead relying on differences in DNA tetramer frequencies. Given that all the six methods appear to have their own strengths and limitations, we used the consensus of their rankings to infer that &amp;gt;5% of cyanobacterial genome assemblies are highly contaminated by foreign DNA (i.e., contaminants were detected by 5 or 6 methods). Our results will help researchers to check the quality of publicly available genomic data before use in their own analyses. Moreover, we argue that journals should make mandatory the submission of raw read data along with genome assemblies in order to facilitate the detection of contaminants in sequence databases.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0200323&#34;&gt;https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0200323&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>High-Throughput Sequencing Analysis of the Actinobacterial Spatial Diversity in Moonmilk Deposits</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;*&lt;em&gt;Marta Maciejewska, Magdalena Całusińska, Luc Cornet,Delphine Adam, Igor S. Pessi 1, Sandrine Malchair, Philippe Delfosse,Denis Baurain, Hazel A. Barton,Monique Carnol, and Sébastien Rigali&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Moonmilk are cave carbonate deposits that host a rich microbiome, including antibiotic-producing Actinobacteria, making these speleothems appealing for bioprospecting. Here, we investigated the taxonomic profile of the actinobacterial community of three moonmilk deposits of the cave “Grotte des Collemboles” via high-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA amplicons. Actinobacteria was the most common phylum after Proteobacteria, ranging from 9% to 23% of the total bacterial population. Next to actinobacterial operational taxonomic units (OTUs) attributed to uncultured organisms at the genus level (~44%), we identified 47 actinobacterial genera with Rhodoccocus (4 OTUs, 17%) and Pseudonocardia (9 OTUs, ~16%) as the most abundant in terms of the absolute number of sequences. Streptomycetes presented the highest diversity (19 OTUs, 3%), with most of the OTUs unlinked to the culturable Streptomyces strains that were previously isolated from the same deposits. Furthermore, 43% of the OTUs were shared between the three studied collection points, while 34% were exclusive to one deposit, indicating that distinct speleothems host their own population, despite their nearby localization. This important spatial diversity suggests that prospecting within different moonmilk deposits should result in the isolation of unique and novel Actinobacteria. These speleothems also host a wide range of non-streptomycetes antibiotic-producing genera, and should therefore be subjected to methodologies for isolating rare Actinobacteria.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://doi.org/10.3390/antibiotics7020027&#34;&gt;https://doi.org/10.3390/antibiotics7020027&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Metagenomic assembly of new (sub)polar Cyanobacteria and their associated microbiome from non-axenic cultures</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Luc Cornet, Amandine R. Bertrand, Marc Hanikenne​, Emmanuelle J. Javaux, Annick Wilmotte​ and Denis Baurain&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Cyanobacteria form one of the most diversified phyla of Bacteria. They are important ecologically as primary producers, for Earth evolution and biotechnological applications. Yet, Cyanobacteria are notably difficult to purify and grow axenically, and most strains in culture collections contain heterotrophic bacteria that were probably associated with Cyanobacteria in the environment. Obtaining cyanobacterial DNA without contaminant sequences is thus a challenging and time-consuming task. Here, we describe a metagenomic pipeline that enables the easy recovery of genomes from non-axenic cultures. We tested this pipeline on 17 cyanobacterial cultures from the BCCM/ULC public collection and generated novel genome sequences for 12 polar or subpolar strains and three temperate ones, including three early-branching organisms that will be useful for phylogenomics. In parallel, we assembled 31 co-cultivated bacteria (12 nearly complete) from the same cultures and showed that they mostly belong to Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria, some of them being very closely related in spite of geographically distant sampling sites.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://doi.org/10.1099/mgen.0.000212&#34;&gt;https://doi.org/10.1099/mgen.0.000212&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
