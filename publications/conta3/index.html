    <title>Contamination detection in genomic data: more is not enough | Luc Cornet</title>
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,minimum-scale=1">
    <meta name="description" content="Luc Cornet and Denis Baurain
The decreasing cost of sequencing and concomitant augmentation of publicly available genomes have created an acute need for automated software to assess genomic contamination. During the last 6 years, 18 programs have been published, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. Deciding which tools to use becomes more and more difficult without an understanding of the underlying algorithms. We review these programs, benchmarking six of them, and present their main operating principles. This article is intended to guide researchers in the selection of appropriate tools for specific applications. Finally, we present future challenges in the developing field of contamination detection.
