    <title>Horizontal Gene Transfers Underpin Ribose Heterotrophy and Central Carbon Metabolism Remodeling in Gloeobacteraceae | Luc Cornet</title>

Gloeobacterales has long been considered a “living fossil” cyanobacterial order, owing to its lack of thylakoid membranes and basal phylogenetic position. However, our study reveals that Gloeobacterales actively integrate horizontally transferred genes into their core metabolism. In Gloeobacteraceae—one of the two families within the order—these genes encode a complete ribose ATP synthase binding cassette (ABC) importer and downstream enzymes, enabling the heterotrophic uptake of external ribose and its assimilation into central carbon metabolism, along with photosynthesis, indicative of photomixotrophy. Beyond ribose utilization, their central carbon metabolism exhibits a mosaic architecture shaped by the integration of foreign genes into the Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle, the pentose phosphate pathway, and the Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas pathway. Uniquely, these genes appear to have been acquired through multiple independent transfer events, as reflected by their dispersed genomic locations and diverse bacterial donors, including other cyanobacteria and Pseudomonadota. These findings contradict the long-standing view of Gloeobacterales as metabolically primitive relics. Instead, Gloeobacterales is likely a dynamic lineage that continues to adapt and evolve through metabolic innovation and the assimilation of foreign genes into its genomes.
