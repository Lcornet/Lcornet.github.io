Oxygenic photosynthesis is a biochemical process of fundamental importance for life on Earth, as it converts solar energy into chemical energy while releasing oxygen. This process emerged more than 2.4 billion years ago within cyanobacteria, a group of bacteria that subsequently colonized a wide range of terrestrial and aquatic habitats.
Cyanobacteria are responsible for a substantial fraction of global photosynthesis, notably through their presence in marine phytoplankton. Among extant cyanobacteria, there is a very primitive group known as the Gloeobacterales, which is distinguished by the absence of thylakoids, an intracellular structure essential for photosynthesis in most cyanobacteria. This absence makes Gloeobacterales an important source of information for understanding the origin and evolution of oxygenic photosynthesis.">

<p>Oxygenic photosynthesis is a biochemical process of fundamental importance for life on Earth, as it converts solar energy into chemical energy while releasing oxygen. This process emerged more than 2.4 billion years ago within cyanobacteria, a group of bacteria that subsequently colonized a wide range of terrestrial and aquatic habitats.</p>
<p>Cyanobacteria are responsible for a substantial fraction of global photosynthesis, notably through their presence in marine phytoplankton. Among extant cyanobacteria, there is a very primitive group known as the Gloeobacterales, which is distinguished by the absence of thylakoids, an intracellular structure essential for photosynthesis in most cyanobacteria. This absence makes Gloeobacterales an important source of information for understanding the origin and evolution of oxygenic photosynthesis.</p>
<p>Gloeobacterales are a rare group, and only a few cultures are currently available. Genomic data indicate that these cyanobacteria are notably found in caves, especially near cave entrances. The aim of this citizen science project is to collect environmental samples that will subsequently be isolated and cultured in the laboratory.</p>
<p>In practice, interested citizens can contact Luc Cornet (see the contact section) to receive a sampling kit composed notably  of sampling tubes, a lux meter, and sterilization solution. The kit also includes an information sheet and a unique code for each sample collected. Detailed instructions are provided on how to perform the sampling, in particular to preserve the original populations. In return, participants are informed of the scientific results of the study, notably the microbial diversity encountered in caves.</p>
